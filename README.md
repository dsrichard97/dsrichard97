  <h2 align="center">üå† About Me <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=dsrichard97&color=orange" title="Page View Count"></h2>
  <p>
    My name is Richard and I am a statistican who utilize logical programming to extract meaningful insights from data using appealing visualizations, statistical techniques, and machine learning. My expertise encompasses the creation of compelling data visualizations and the application of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to address real-world problems. I am proficient in utilizing a suite of Python libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly, to develop insightful visual representations of data. Additionally, I leverage Tableau for the creation of dashboard reports that highlight essential KPIs and ensure data cleanliness.

My statistical methodology is comprehensive, incorporating techniques such as correlation analysis, t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA/MANOVA, among others, to uncover underlying patterns and relationships within data. I am adept at designing and implementing robust experimental setups, including A/B testing, to validate results and inform strategic decisions.

My foundation in statistics is strengthened by a deep understanding of Linear Algebra, Statistical Inference, Optimization, and Probability, which underpins my ability to develop and evaluate machine learning models with appropriate assumptions. I am committed to continuous learning and staying at the forefront of the field, regularly engaging with the latest research in machine learning, staying updated with current data techniques through platforms like Medium, and following thought leaders in Artificial Intelligence.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the future I see myself sharing my knowledge and helping others learn. I see myself creating full tutorials on projects that relate to Data Science and Data Engineering on my GitHub. I plan to start writing blogs on Medium and uploading more work onto Kaggle. I hope to inspire new comers into the world of Data by taking a simplistic approach in my methods that will motivate them to grow.

      Iowa Sales Report
      <p>
        Iowa is home to numerous liquor sales hotspots, and this dataset provides a comprehensive view of the wholesale market. Utilizing data visualization tools like Excel, Looker(SQL Daily Reports), and PowerBI, I have highlighted key sales metrics and honed in on local geography to accurately identify hotspot locations. The dashboards are meticulously crafted to represent local sales and volume accurately, with a focus on creating user-centric designs that are straightforward and intuitive. This approach ensures that the data visualizations not only convey actionable insights but are also easily interpretable, facilitating informed decision-making.

      Medicare Dual Enrollment
      <p> Health insurance companies and hospital admission departments consistently strive to enhance their membership bases to offer high-quality services to individuals and the broader community. These entities are keen to gain a deeper understanding of their target demographics in social, economic, and geographical terms. The aim of this initial exploratory analysis is to examine the characteristics of individuals enrolled between 2015 and 2019. The data utilized in this study was retrieved using SQL queries from a database hosted on Google Cloud, specifically focusing on Dual Enrollment. This method provides insights from the standpoint of statistical inference, laying the groundwork for preliminary analyses that could support the modeling of time series or the creation of heatmaps to pinpoint areas with a high concentration of current enrollees.
